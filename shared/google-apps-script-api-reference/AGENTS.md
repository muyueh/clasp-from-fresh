# Agent Instructions

When working anywhere under this reference library (`shared/google-apps-script-api-reference/`):

1. **Start with `keyword-index/`.** Use the keyword summaries to locate the service or concept quickly. These files are the primary entry point for understanding the generated reference content.
2. **Consult `full-reference/` if more detail is required.** Once you identify the relevant keyword entry, jump to the corresponding table in `full-reference/` for the complete parameter descriptions and examples.
3. **Verify reference links.** Any time you touch documentation that links out to product references, double-check that the URLs in `full-reference/` still resolve and match the Google Apps Script docs they describe.
4. **Use the reference URLs for troubleshooting.** If you run into a bug or unclear behavior, follow the `full-reference/` link to the Google documentation for deeper examples before making changes here.

Follow this workflow before editing or generating content so that updates stay synchronized between the keyword index, the full references, and the documented URLs.
