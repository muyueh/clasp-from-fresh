## `source/`: canonical service docs

The `source/` directory is the single source of truth for every service. Each markdown
file mirrors the upstream Google Workspace/Apps Script service reference and is the only
place you should manually edit descriptions, parameters, or new endpoints. Organize new
services by adding a `<service>.md` file under this folder so the generator can discover
it automatically.

## Generated outputs (`full-reference/` and `keyword-index/`)

The `generate_keyword_versions.py` script ingests every markdown file under `source/`
and emits two trees:

- `full-reference/` – contains the full tables for each service, preserving all sections,
  methods, and details exactly as they appear in the canonical files. Use these files
  when you need exhaustive information.
- `keyword-index/` – contains concise bullet lists distilled from the same canonical tables.
  Each bullet highlights the primary method name plus the key parameters or behaviors,
  providing a scannable overview of the service surface area.

Whenever you update any file in `source/` (including adding or removing services) you
must re-run `python3 generate_keyword_versions.py` from the repository root. The script
fully regenerates both output trees and deletes stale artifacts so `full-reference/` and
`keyword-index/` always stay in sync with the upstream content.

## Interpreting keyword files vs. complete files

Think of the `full-reference/` files as full-fidelity tables you can copy directly into other
references, while the `keyword-index/` files are intentionally terse summaries for quick
triage. Each keyword bullet corresponds to a row in the matching complete table. If you
need the context behind a bullet, locate the same service/method file in `full-reference/` for
expanded columns and prose.

## Adding or updating services

1. **Create or edit canonical docs** – Modify the appropriate markdown file under
   `source/` or add a new `<service>.md` file if the service is new. Keep formatting
   consistent with existing tables so the generator can parse it.
2. **Regenerate outputs** – Run `python3 generate_keyword_versions.py`. Commit the
   updated files in `source/`, `full-reference/`, and `keyword-index/` together so reviewers can see
   the canonical change and both derived representations.
3. **Verify relationships** – Spot-check that every new or updated section in
   `full-reference/` has a corresponding bullet list in `keyword-index/`. If something is missing,
   re-run the script or fix the source formatting.

Following this workflow ensures the repository always reflects the latest upstream
service documentation, with both comprehensive and quick-reference formats readily
available.
