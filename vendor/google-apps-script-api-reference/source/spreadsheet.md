# Spreadsheet Service

Spreadsheet

This service allows scripts to create, access, and modify Google Sheets
files. See also the [guide to
storing data in spreadsheets](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/storing_data_spreadsheets).

Sometimes, spreadsheet operations are bundled together to improve performance, such as when
doing multiple calls to a method. If you want to make sure that all pending
changes are made right away, for instance to show users information as a script is executing,
call [`Spreadsheet``App.flush()`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/spreadsheet-app#flush).
